AVR Studio Version 6

Date: 19th October 2012

 Application example: Robot control over serial port via XBee wireless communication module 
 					  (located on the ATMEGA260 microcontroller adaptor board)

 Concepts covered:  serial communication
 
 Serial Port used: UART0

 There are two components to the motion control:
 1. Direction control using pins PORTA0 to PORTA3
 2. Velocity control by PWM on pins PL3 and PL4 using OC5A and OC5B.

 In this experiment for the simplicity PL3 and PL4 are kept at logic 1.
 
 Pins for PWM are kept at logic 1.
  
 Connection Details:  	
 						
  Motion control:		L-1---->PA0;		L-2---->PA1;
   						R-1---->PA2;		R-2---->PA3;
   						PL3 (OC5A) ----> Logic 1; 	PL4 (OC5B) ----> Logic 1; 


  Serial Communication:	PORTD 2 --> RXD1 UART1 receive for RS232 serial communication
						PORTD 3 --> TXD1 UART1 transmit for RS232 serial communication

						PORTH 0 --> RXD2 UART 2 receive for USB - RS232 communication
						PORTH 1 --> TXD2 UART 2 transmit for USB - RS232 communication

						PORTE 0 --> RXD0 UART0 receive for ZigBee wireless communication
						PORTE 1 --> TXD0 UART0 transmit for ZigBee wireless communication

						PORTJ 0 --> RXD3 UART3 receive available on microcontroller expansion socket
						PORTJ 1 --> TXD3 UART3 transmit available on microcontroller expansion socket

Serial communication baud rate: 9600bps
To control robot use number pad of the keyboard which is located on the right hand side of the keyboard.
Make sure that NUM lock is on.

Commands:
			Keyboard Key   ASCII value	Action
				8				0x38	Forward
				2				0x32	Backward
				4				0x34	Left
				6				0x36	Right
				5				0x35	Stop
				7				0x37	Buzzer on
				9				0x39	Buzzer off

 Note: 
 
 1. Make sure that in the configuration options following settings are 
 	done for proper operation of the code

 	Microcontroller: atmega2560
 	Frequency: 14745600
 	Optimization: -O0 (For more information read section: Selecting proper optimization 
 						options below figure 2.22 in the Software Manual)

 2. Difference between the codes for RS232 serial, USB and wireless communication is only in the serial port number.
 	Rest of the things are the same. 

 3. For USB communication check the Jumper 1 position on the ATMEGA2560 microcontroller adaptor board

 4. Auxiliary power can supply current up to 1 Ampere while Battery can supply current up to 
 	2 Ampere. When both motors of the robot changes direction suddenly without stopping, 
	it produces large current surge. When robot is powered by Auxiliary power which can supply
	only 1 Ampere of current, sudden direction change in both the motors will cause current 
	surge which can reset the microcontroller because of sudden fall in voltage. 
	It is a good practice to stop the motors for at least 0.5seconds before changing 
	the direction. This will also increase the useable time of the fully charged battery.
	the life of the motor.
