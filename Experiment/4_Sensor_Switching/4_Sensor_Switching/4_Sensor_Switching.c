 This experiment demostrates switching on and off of MOSFET switches to turn on and off the active part of the sensors.
  
 Connections:
 				PORTG 2 --> Power control of Sharp IR Range sensor 2, 3, 4 and red LEDs of the white line sensors
				PORTH 2 --> Power control of Sharp IR Range sensor 1, 5
				PORTH 3 --> Power control of IR Proximity sensors 1 to 8
 
 
 

 Note: 
 
 1. Make sure that in the configuration options following settings are 
 done for proper operation of the code

 Microcontroller: atmega2560
 Frequency: 14745600
 Optimization: -O0 (For more information read section: Selecting proper optimization 
 					options below figure 2.22 in the Software Manual)

 2. Make sure that Jumper 2, 3, 4 are open on the main board

 3. Logic 1 to any of the pin turns off the power to the corresponding sensor.
 Logic 0 to any of the above pin turns on the power to the corresponding sensor.

 4. To use IR proximity sensor as directional light intensity sensor, turn off IR proximity
 sensor. It will turn off IR LEDs.
