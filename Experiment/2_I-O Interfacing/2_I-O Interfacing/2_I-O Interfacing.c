 This experiment demonstrates simple Input and Output operation.
 When switch is pressed buzzer and bargraph LED display is turned on.
 When switch is opened buzzer and bargraph display are turned off
 
 Concepts covered:
 Input and Output operations

 Connections:
 Buzzer: PORTC 3
 LED bargraph: PORTJ 7 to PORTJ 0
 Interrupt switch: PORTE 7

 Note: 
 
 1. Make sure that in the configuration options following settings are 
 done for proper operation of the code

 Microcontroller: atmega2560
 Frequency: 14745600
 Optimization: -O0 (For more information read section: Selecting proper optimization 
 					options below figure 2.22 in the Software Manual)

 2. Jumper J3 is in place to enable LED bargraph display on the ATMEGA2560 microcontroller 
 adaptor board
