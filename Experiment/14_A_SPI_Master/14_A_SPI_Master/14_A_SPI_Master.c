 This program is for ATMEGA2560 (master) microcontroller
 This program demonstrates SPI communication between master (ATMEGA2560) and slave (ATMEGA8) microcontroller.
 LCD displays analog values of the IR Proximity sensors 6, 7, 8 which are obtained from the ATMEGA8 (slave) microcontroller.

 Concepts covered:  SPI communication
 
 Fire Bird V ATMEGA2560 have ATMEGA2560 (master) and ATMEGA8 (slave) microcontrollers.
 These two microcontrollers are connected with the SPI bus. Main function of the slave microcontroller is to 
 take analog readings from the sensors and send it back to the ATMEGA2560 (master) microcontroller.
 To get ADC data from channel number 'n' of the ATMEGA8 (slave) microcontroller send 'n' as parameter in 
 the function "spi_master_tx_and_rx"

 Returned ADC data from the ATMEGA8 (slave) microcontroller for 
 parameter 'n' given to the function "spi_master_tx_and_rx"
			
			Number sent		ADC channel data
				0			Analog value of white line sensor 4 (if connected)
				1			Analog value of white line sensor 5 (if connected)	or from servo pod		
				2			Analog value of white line sensor 6 (if connected)
				3			Analog value of white line sensor 7 (if connected)	or from servo pod		
				4			Analog value of sensed current by ACS712 current sensor (if installed)
				5			Analog value of IR proximity sensor 6
				6			Analog value of IR proximity sensor 7
				7			Analog value of IR proximity sensor 8

 Note: 
 
 1. Make sure that in the configuration options following settings are 
 	done for proper operation of the code

 	Microcontroller: atmega2560
 	Frequency: 14745600
 	Optimization: -O0 (For more information read section: Selecting proper optimization 
 					options below figure 2.22 in the Software Manual)

 2. ATMEGA2560 (master) and ATMEGA8 (slave) microcontrollers use SPI bus for ISP as well as 
 	for the communication between them. Before doing ISP we need to disconnect the SPI bus between
	these two microcontrollers. Remove tree jumpers marked by J4 on the ATMEGA2560 microcontroller
	adaptor board before doing ISP.
 
 3. Connect 3 jumpers marked by J4 to connect SPI bus between the microcontrollers.

 4. Do not pass value more than 7 to the function "spi_master_tx_and_rx" else it will give back random value
