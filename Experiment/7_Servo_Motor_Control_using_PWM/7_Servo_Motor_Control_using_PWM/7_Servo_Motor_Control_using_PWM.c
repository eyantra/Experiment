 This experiment demonstrates Servo motor control using 10 bit fast PWM mode.

 Concepts covered:  Use of timer to generate PWM for servo motor control

 Fire Bird V ATMEGA2560 microcontroller board has connection for 3 servo motors (S1, S2, S3).
 Servo motors move between 0 to 180 degrees proportional to the pulse train 
 with the on time of 0.6 to 2 ms with the frequency between 40 to 60 Hz. 50Hz is most recommended.

 We are using Timer 1 at 10 bit fast PWM mode to generate servo control waveform.
 In this mode servo motors can be controlled with the angular resolution of 1.86 degrees.
 Although angular resolution is less this is very simple method.
 
 There are better ways to produce very high resolution PWM but it involves interrupts at the frequency of the PWM.
 High resolution PWM is used for servo control in the Hexapod robot.
  
 Connection Details:	PORTB 5 OC1A --> Servo 1: Camera pod pan servo
 						PORTB 6 OC1B --> Servo 2: Camera pod tile servo
						PORTB 7 OC1C --> Servo 3: Reserved 
 					  	
 Note: 
 
 1. Make sure that in the configuration options following settings are 
 	done for proper operation of the code

 	Microcontroller: atmega2560
 	Frequency: 14745600
 	Optimization: -O0 (For more information read section: Selecting proper optimization 
 					options below figure 2.22 in the Software Manual)

 2. 5V supply to these motors is provided by separate low drop voltage regulator "5V Servo" which can
 	supply maximum of 800mA current. It is a good practice to move one servo at a time to reduce power surge 
	in the robot's supply lines. Also preferably take ADC readings while servo motor is not moving or stopped
	moving after giving desired position.
