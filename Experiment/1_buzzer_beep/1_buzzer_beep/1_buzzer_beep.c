 This experiment demonstrates the simple operation of Buzzer ON/OFF with
 one second delay. Buzzer is connected to PORTC.3 of ATMEGAM2560

 Concepts covered:
 Output operation, generating exact delay

 Note: Make sure that in the configuration options following settings are 
 done for proper operation of the code

 Microcontroller: atmega2560
 Frequency: 14745600
 Optimization: -O0 (For more information read section: Selecting proper optimization 
 					options below figure 2.22 in the Software Manual)
